# Real-Time Fraud Detection System for Financial Transactions

## Overview
This project implements a real-time fraud detection system that processes transaction data, identifies potentially fraudulent activities, and sends alerts for any detected anomalies.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains any relevant datasets or pre-trained models.
- **sql_queries/**: SQL scripts to create tables, insert data, and detect fraud.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data processing, fraud detection, and alerting.
- **dashboards/**: Placeholder for PowerBI dashboards.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd fraud-detection-system`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up the SQL database by running the scripts in the `sql_queries/` directory.
5. Run the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory to process data, detect fraud, and send alerts.
6. Add PowerBI dashboards to the `dashboards/` directory for visualization (optional).

## Usage
Run the Python scripts to process transaction data, detect fraud, and automatically send alerts if any fraudulent activity is detected.
